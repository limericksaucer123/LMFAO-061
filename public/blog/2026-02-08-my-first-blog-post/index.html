           <p><em>Letter from the editor</em></p>
<p>The <strong>Limerick Music and investigation of Fortean Anomalous phenomena Organisation</strong> is hereby established in this fair city. Over the last number of weeks , streetwalkers and publicans may have noticed striking white posters advertising our group. The posters acted as a preemptive call to those in Limerick who create art , but most importantly have suffered a paranormal occurrence.</p>
<p>The response was abysmal. Within a week all posters were torn down. A number of them removed by rain but the rest show signs of being ripped down by  human hands. The owner of such hands are unknown but one thing is known for sure : they hate joy , love , limerick music and the human race as a whole.</p>
<p>The only place where one survived was <strong>Pharmacia</strong> , a Beer castle where the arts are respected.</p>
<p>I received two responses. Neither of which have turned up anything of substance. One man who approached me during my work as a bartender mentioned that <strong>he sensed ghosts in the bathroom</strong>. I pressed him for more and he spun a tale about how every member of his family was very sensitive to <strong>'this stuff'</strong>. I explained that I was a journalist and very interested in his story. He went to write his email on a piece of receipt paper but very quickly balled it up into his pocket and left. I noticed his pupils were huge , I thought that he was on cocaine but my coworker believed it was acid. Either way , useless interaction. I probably scared him off with the L.M.F.A.O talk.</p>
<p>Although I am very interested in the paranormal and high strangeness , the major output of this website will not relate to those topics at all. If i do receive a report , we will investigate or report.</p>
<p>This website aims to be a hub of  local art , opinions and news. For this to work , I need a chorus of voices. Stories and work from Journalists , poets , musicians , authors , drug dealers , painters , construction workers , activists , computer technicians , thatcher's , cinema workers and everyone in-between <strong>hold immense value</strong> to us.</p>
<p>If you would like to work with us send an email to <strong>Limericksaucer123@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
<p>Submissions will very rarely be rejected. <strong>Tip-offs are also very badly needed</strong> , this journalistic eco-system will only work if everyone's whispering to eachother about different things. If you are organising an event , send it on. If you are attending an event then consider writing up an article about your night. It doesnt have to be a formal conrete block of text ,  it can be as creative or irreverant as you like.</p>
<p><strong>Stop passively consuming and get engaged , it is badly needed.</strong></p>
<p>If your brain is in the same state as my own ,then instagram reels and tik tok is an evil highly addictive monster that placates and dilutes your passions.</p>

This website acts as a centralized source of articles and investigative pieces produced by our members. The topics include news , famous cases of high strangeness , crime , musings on local issues , interviews with musicians/bands , album reviews , gig guides , cults , scene reports , investigative journalism , monsters , wolfmen , cryptids of all sorts etc. We accept submissions of all forms : articles , prose , short stories, poems , paintings , mp3 files , pieces of paper , email , letter. If you believe the masses must see it then we will post it.
