The Limerick Music and investigation of Fortean Anomalous phenomena Organisation is hereby established in this fair city. Over the last number of weeks , streetwalkers and publicans may have noticed striking white posters advertising our group. The posters acted as a preemptive call to those in Limerick who create art , but most importantly have suffered a paranormal occurrence.  

The response was abysmal. Within a week all posters were torn down. A number of them removed by rain but the rest show signs of being ripped down by gnarled human hands. The owner of such hands are unknown but one thing is known for sure : they hate joy , love , limerick music and the human race as a whole. 

The only place where one survived was Pharmacia , a Beer castle where the arts are respected.

This website aims to be a hub of  local art , opinion and news , but for this to work I need a chorus of voices.  Journalists , poets , musicians , authors , drug dealers , painters , construction workers , activists , computer technicians , thatchers , cinema workers and everyone inbetween knows something to someone that needs attention. If you would like to work with us send an email to Limericksaucer123@gmail.com. Submissions will very rarely be rejected. Tip-offs are also very badly needed , this journalistic eco-system will only work if everyone's whispering to eachother about different things. If you are organising an event , send it on. If you are attending an event then consider writing up an article about your night. It doesnt have to be a formal conrete block of text ,  it can be as creative or irreverant as you like. 

Stop passively consuming and get engaged , it is badly needed. If your brain is in the same state as my own ,then instagram reels and tik tok is an evil highly addictive monster that placates and dilutes your passions.
